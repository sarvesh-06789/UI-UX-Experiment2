# UI-UX-Experiment2

Arrange elements along straight lines or smooth curves to guide the eye naturally.

Example: Product details flowing from image → description → price → CTA.

Closure

Use card layouts and rounded containers that feel “complete” to the user.

b. UI Elements & Design Patterns
Mobile Layout

Top Bar: Logo + Search icon + Menu icon (hamburger).

Hero Section: Image slider with headline + CTA button.

Content Cards: Products/Services displayed in cards (image + title + price/action).

Web Layout

Header: Logo left, navigation center (Home, About, Services, Contact), Search + Profile right.

Hero Banner: Full-width image with overlay text and CTA.

Content Grid: 3 or 4-column product/service cards.

CTA Buttons (Primary: filled, Secondary: outlined)

c. Interaction Behaviors & Usability Principles

Consistency: Colors, icons, and interactions remain the same across mobile & web.

Feedback: Buttons animate or change color when tapped/clicked.

Affordance: Buttons look clickable (raised or shadowed).

Error Prevention: Forms with inline validation (e.g., “Invalid email”).

Accessibility: High contrast, readable font size, alt-text for images.

Mobile First: Layout designed for small screens first, then adapted to web.
