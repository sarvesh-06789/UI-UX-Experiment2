# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim:
To design responsive mobile and web layouts for an existing digital product by applying Gestalt principles, UI patterns, usability guidelines, and branding techniques — ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Algorithm:
a. Applying Gestalt Principles

Gestalt principles help users perceive order and clarity in design. Here’s how to apply them:

Proximity

Group related elements (e.g., navigation links, product info) close together.

In mobile: Keep navigation compact at the bottom.

In web: Use grouped menu categories at the top.

Similarity

Use consistent button shapes, colors, and typography to signal similar actions.

Example: All call-to-action (CTA) buttons in the same bold color.

Figure-Ground

Ensure important content (product, form, call-to-action) stands out against background.

Example: Light background with dark text, or card-style product displays.

Continuity

Arrange elements along straight lines or smooth curves to guide the eye naturally.

Example: Product details flowing from image → description → price → CTA.

Closure

Use card layouts and rounded containers that feel “complete” to the user.

b. UI Elements & Design Patterns
Mobile Layout

Top Bar: Logo + Search icon + Menu icon (hamburger).

Hero Section: Image slider with headline + CTA button.

Content Cards: Products/Services displayed in cards (image + title + price/action).

Bottom Navigation Bar: Home, Categories, Cart, Profile.

Web Layout

Header: Logo left, navigation center (Home, About, Services, Contact), Search + Profile right.

Hero Banner: Full-width image with overlay text and CTA.

Content Grid: 3 or 4-column product/service cards.

Sidebar/Filters (if e-commerce case).
Footer: Links, contact info, social media icons.

Design Patterns used:

Card Layouts for products

Bottom Navigation for mobile usability

Search Bar (predictive search for better UX)

CTA Buttons (Primary: filled, Secondary: outlined)

c. Interaction Behaviors & Usability Principles

Consistency: Colors, icons, and interactions remain the same across mobile & web.

Feedback: Buttons animate or change color when tapped/clicked.

Affordance: Buttons look clickable (raised or shadowed).

Error Prevention: Forms with inline validation (e.g., “Invalid email”).

Accessibility: High contrast, readable font size, alt-text for images.

Mobile First: Layout designed for small screens first, then adapted to web.

## Output:
<img width="542" height="543" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9e6c516-2fff-4a31-8a4b-abe5000c4bb3" />


## Result:
Successfully designed a mobile and web layout was designed using Gestalt principles, standard UI patterns, and usability practices. A brand logo was created in Canva to establish a clear and consistent visual identity.
